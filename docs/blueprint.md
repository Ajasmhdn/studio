## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a calm blue (#5DADE2) to evoke trust and knowledge. It is suitable for an educational website, making the overall theme consistent and professional.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), almost white, to maintain a clean and uncluttered appearance, allowing content to stand out. The color is only lightly desaturated to reduce distraction.
- Accent color: Soft green (#A3E4D7) for interactive elements and highlights, complementing the blue and creating visual interest. It is brighter and more saturated to stand out.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif suitable for body text.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif appropriate for headlines.
- Employ a set of professional, minimalist icons to visually represent different sections and functions.
- Maintain a clean and modular layout, ensuring all sections are logically structured and easy to navigate.
